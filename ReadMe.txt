Clients Requirements -

“I run a small computer consultancy firm with a number of employees. 
Along with the  basic information about the employees (name, DoB, contact details, etc.)
I need to be able to keep track of what type of role they perform, such as Hardware Technician, Programmer, and Software Installer. 
A single employee can perform multiple roles, and each role has an associated hourly pay.
I need to keep name and contact details of all customers that have a contract with us. 
A customer can have multiple contracts at the same time, but each contract is only associated with one customer. 
Each contract has a name, a description, a creation date, and a job type – e.g. System Development, Software Upgrade. 
No details of job types need to be captured other than their name. 
Each contract also has a single employee designated as the project leader.
One employee may be the project leader of multiple contracts.”
